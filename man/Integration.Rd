\usage{
Integration(data, rt = c(8.3, 9), brt = c(8.3, 8.4), smoothit = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{file should be a dataframe with the first column RT and second column intensity of the SIM ions.}

\item{rt}{a rough RT range contained only one peak to get the area}

\item{brt}{a rough RT range contained only one peak and enough noises to get the area}

\item{smoothit}{logical, if using an average smooth box or not. If using, n will be used}
}
\value{
area intergration data
}
