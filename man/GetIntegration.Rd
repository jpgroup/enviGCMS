\title{GetIntegration was mainly used for get the intergration of certain ion's chromatogram data and plot the data}
\usage{
GetIntegration(data, rt = c(8.3, 9), n = 5, m = 5, slope = c(2, 2),
  baseline = 10, noslope = T, smoothit = T, half = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{file should be a dataframe with the first column RT and second column intensity of the SIM ions.}

\item{rt}{a rough RT range contained only one peak to get the area}

\item{n}{points in the moving average smooth box, default value is 5}

\item{m}{numbers of points for regression to get the slope}

\item{slope}{the threshold value for start/stop peak as percentage of max slope}

\item{baseline}{numbers of the points for the baseline of the signal}

\item{noslope}{logical, if using a horizon line to get area or not}

\item{smoothit}{logical, if using an average smooth box or not. If using, n will be used}

\item{half}{logical, if using the left half peak to caculate the area}
}
\value{
intergration data such as peak area, peak hight, signal and the slope data.
